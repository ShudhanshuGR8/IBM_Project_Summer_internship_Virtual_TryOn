# Virtual Try-On Project - Summer 2023 Internship at IBM

Welcome to the Virtual Try-On Project! This project is part of my summer internship at IBM in 2023. The goal of this project is to develop a virtual try-on system that allows users to visualize how different clothing items would look on them using augmented reality (AR) technology. This README.md file provides an overview of the project, its features, setup instructions, and other relevant information.

## Project Overview

The Virtual Try-On Project aims to enhance the online shopping experience by allowing users to virtually try on clothing items before making a purchase. By leveraging AR technology, users can see how different outfits would look on them in real-time without physically trying them on.

## Features

- **Augmented Reality Visualization:** The project utilizes AR technology to superimpose virtual clothing items onto the user's live video feed, giving them a realistic preview of how the clothes would look on them.

- **Clothing Selection:** Users can choose from a variety of clothing items available in the project's database. This includes different types of clothing such as shirts, dresses, pants, and accessories.

- **Realistic Rendering:** The AR system employs advanced rendering techniques to ensure that the virtual clothing items blend seamlessly with the user's appearance, taking into account lighting, shadows, and other environmental factors.

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The project features an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the clothing selection, adjust settings, and capture images or short videos of their virtual try-on sessions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
